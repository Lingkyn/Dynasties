## Obstacle Tiles

Players can place one-time directional arrows that force others to move in specific directions.

## Calamity Event Spaces

When citizen tokens pass through calamity event spaces, a calamity event is triggered. The turn player spins the number wheel, and the faction owning the corresponding tile must spin the calamity wheel. If no faction owns that tile, nothing happens.
