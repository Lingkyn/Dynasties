# Governance System

## Military System

### Citizen Token Movement

* Roll dice; the sum of all dice is the total movement steps for all citizen tokens this turn.
* 1 citizen moving 1 space = 1 step

### Occupy Land

* If citizen tokens end their movement on an empty land space, they occupy that land for the faction.

### Faction Combat

During the military action phase, if citizen tokens from different factions occupy the same space, combat occurs.

* Battle Power = Military + number of citizen tokens
* Losing faction's tokens are eliminated; winning faction's tokens are reduced based on the battle difference.

### Place Obstacles

When a citizen token is placed on an empty space, flip an obstacle tile and set up a one-time directional movement for that space.
