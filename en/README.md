  Tang / Song / Yuan / Ming, each with unique starting attributes, titles, and policy combinations, representing the institutional characteristics and development directions of each dynasty.  

- **Four-Dimension Attribute System**:  
  - **Military**: Determines battle power and participates in judgments for invasion, rebellion, and coup events.  
  - **Livelihood**: Determines the number of citizen tokens each round, and rebellion events trigger when too low.  
  - **Wealth**: Determines the number of coins each round, and corruption events trigger when too high.  
  - **Faith**: The faction's "life points"; consuming faith when other attributes drop to 0.  

- **Governance Wheel**:  
  Each turn, a wheel determines which system to enter: **Military / Livelihood / Wealth / Faith**, handling expansion, citizen needs, taxation, and disaster response respectively.  

- **Calamity System**:  
  Natural disasters like drought, earthquakes, floods, and plague, as well as human-made calamities like rebellion, invasion, coup, and corruption, trigger under specific conditions, testing players' resource allocation and risk management.  

- **Title and Policy System**:  
  Through executing / issuing policy cards with different titles, players can respond to disasters, adjust attributes, and form unique governance paths for each faction.
