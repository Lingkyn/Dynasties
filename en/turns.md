# Turn Sequence

Each turn consists of 3 phases, executed in the following order:

## Phase 1: Turn Start

* Gain citizen tokens and coins based on faction attributes:
  * Citizen Tokens = Livelihood + number of faction lands
  * Coins = Wealth × 500
* Each faction may activate one special policy card
  * At most 1 card per turn
  * Only effective this turn, trigger the corresponding effect

## Phase 2: Action Phase (Governance Wheel)

Players take turns spinning the Governance Wheel, entering the corresponding system action:

* Military System Action
* Livelihood System Action
* Wealth System Action
* Faith System Action

After completing a system action, it becomes the next faction's turn to spin the Governance Wheel

## Phase 3: Turn End (Settlement)

* Each faction counts their citizen tokens.
* Pay corresponding grain to support them
* If grain is insufficient, purchase at 100 per unit, or discard citizen tokens.
